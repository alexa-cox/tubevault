    question: 'Do I need a YouTube account to use FocusView?',

    question: 'Can I download videos for offline viewing?',
    answer:
      "FocusView doesn't download or store YouTube videos directly. Instead, it saves references to videos that are still hosted on YouTube. However, Premium plan users can access our offline mode feature which caches videos for limited periods when you know you'll be without internet.",

    question: "What happens if a video I've saved gets deleted from YouTube?",
    answer:
