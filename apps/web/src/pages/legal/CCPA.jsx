          <h3>Reselling Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Under the CCPA, a third-party is prohibited from reselling personal
            information unless you, as the individual about whom the personal
            information is, were given explicit notice and proper opportunity to
            opt-out of further sales.{' '}

          <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p>
            The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific
            rights regarding their personal information. This section describes
            your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Know</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we disclose certain information
            to you about our collection and use of your personal information
            over the past 12 months. This right under the CCPA is the Right to
            Know. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we
            will disclose to you:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.legalOrderedList}>
            <li>
              The categories of personal information we collected about you.

              The categories of sources for the personal information we
              collected about you.

            <li>
              Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that
              personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business

                  information categories that each category of recipient
                  obtained.

          <p>
            <span className={styles.boldText}>Data Portability </span> must be
            maintained, which is also a right under CCPA as amended. This means
            that the information that is provided as a result of data reque sts
            must be in a readily usable format.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Delete</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
            information that we collected from you and retained, subject to
            certain exceptions (the "right to delete"). Once we receive your
            request and confirm your identity, we will review your request to
            see if any exceptions apply that would permit us to retain the
            collected information. We may deny your deletion request if
            retaining the information is necessary for us or our service
            provider(s) to:
          </p>
          <ol className={styles.legalOrderedList}>

          </ol>
          <p>
            We will delete or de-identify personal information not subject to
            one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our service
            providers to take similar action.
          </p>

          <h3>The Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Under CCPA, as amended by CPRA, you have the right to request that
            we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about
            you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and
            the purposes of the processing of the personal information.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive or Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Under the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, consumers also have the
            right to limit the use of the collected sensitive or personal
            information on them to the particular purposes and categories that
            the business collected the information for.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercising CCPA Rights</h3>
          <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
            rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.legalList}>
            <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
            <li>
              Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
              including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
              imposing penalties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods
              or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by
            the CCPA that <span className={styles.boldText}>can result</span> in
            different prices, rates, or quality levels. Participation in a
            financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent,

          <h2>Required Notices at Collection</h2>
          <p>
            Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), businesses
            are required to furnish consumers with specific information via a
            "notice at collection." This notice must identify the categories of
            personal information that the business collects from consumers and
            the reasons why they collect and use such categories of information.
            In the event that the business sells the personal information of
            consumers, the notice at collection must feature a "Do Not Sell or
            Share" hyperlink. Moreover, the notice must include a hyperlink to
            the business's privacy policy, which provides a comprehensive
            overview of the business's privacy practices and the privacy rights
            of consumers. The notice at collection must be issued at or prior to
            the time the business collects the consumer's personal information.

              an authorized representative, which may include:
              <ul>

          </ul>
          <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
            information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
            the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in the request to
            verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it.
          </p>

          <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>
          <p>
            We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business
            days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day
            timeframe, please contact us at {APP_EMAIL}.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your identity and request were verifiable, then we will respond
            within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of the request. If we
            require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the
            reason and extension period in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response

            deliver our written response by mail or electronically at your
            option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
            preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will
            also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
            applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
            to provide your personal information that is readily useable and
            should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
            another entity without hindrance, specifically in CSV format.

          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
            consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
            unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
            tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
            estimate before completing your request.

          <p>
            If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us not to
            sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out").
            We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually
            know are less than 16 years old, unless we receive affirmative
            authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who
            is between 13 and 15 years old, or the parent or guardian of a
            consumer less than 13 years old. Consumers who opt-in to personal
            information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized
            representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following

            Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12)
            months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.
            However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal
            information sales at any time by contacting us at {APP_EMAIL}.
